FEC
This repository contains code for the Federal Election Commission (FEC) project for the RPP2210-FEC-SCAMP course.

Overview
The FEC project involves analyzing campaign finance data from the FEC to understand patterns and trends in political spending. The code in this repository includes scripts for downloading and cleaning the FEC data, as well as notebooks for analyzing and visualizing the data.

Getting Started
To use this code, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You will also need to install the required packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

To download the FEC data, run the download_data.py script. This will download the data from the FEC website and save it to the data/ directory. Note that this may take some time, as the data is quite large.

To clean the data, run the clean_data.py script. This will clean the data and save the cleaned data to the clean_data/ directory.

To analyze the data, open one of the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory. These notebooks contain code for analyzing and visualizing the FEC data.
